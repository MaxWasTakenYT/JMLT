# jstmax-linux-toolbox
a set of stupid tools i created because idk i needed them on my laptop \
you could really just "gitignore" this repo since it's just a personal thing i needed to host somewhere
## available options
* -jmuse / --prepare-for-jstmax-use : installs the packages that i would need on a fresh arch install.
