# jstmax!'s linux toolbox (or smth)
a set of stupid tools i created because idk i needed them on my laptop \
you could really just "gitignore" this repo since it's just a personal thing i needed to host somewhere \

*note: this program uses the username 'maxlol' for every command that needs a username, \
since it is the one i primarily use on my laptop.*
## available options
* **-jmuse** / **--prepare-for-jstmax-use** : installs the packages that i would need on a fresh arch install.
* **-cmd** / **--custom-command** : installs the packages that i would need on a fresh arch install.
