# jstmax!'s Linux Toolbox (JMLT4Short)
a set of FOSS tools for Linux (mainly Arch Linux) \
* note: you **need `figlet`, [`pacmany`]() and [`yayy`]() inside your PATH for JMLT to work properly.**

## build yourself;
it's not like you have a choice, since there are no releases :)
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/MaxWasTakenYT/jstmax-linux-toolbox`
* go inside the repo folder: `cd ./jstmax-linux-toolbox`
* open the 'build' folder: `cd ./build`
* give permissions to 'build-jmlt': `chmod +x ./build-jmlt`
* run 'build-jmlt': `./build-jmlt`
* [recommended] add to PATH: `mv ./jmlt /usr/bin/jmlt`
