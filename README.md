# jstmax!'s Linux Toolbox (JMLT 4 short)
a set of stupid tools i created because idk i needed them on my laptop \
you could really just "gitignore" this repo since it's just a personal thing i needed to host somewhere

## available options;
* **-ju** / **--prepare-for-jstmax-use** : installs the packages that i would need on a fresh arch install.
* **-c** / **--custom-command** : enters a custom command, execute without the command, it will ask you the command later
* **-pmy** / **--pacman-yes** : full implementation of (now defunct) 'jm-pacmany'
* **-yy** / **--yay-yes** : full implementation of (now defunct) 'jm-yayy'

## build yourself;
it's not like you have a choice, since there are no releases :)
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/MaxWasTakenYT/jstmax-linux-toolbox`
* go inside the repo folder: `cd ./jstmax-linux-toolbox`
* open the 'build' folder: `cd ./build`
* give permissions to 'build-jmlt': `chmod +x ./build-jmlt`
* run 'build-jmlt': `./build-jmlt`
* [recommended] add to PATH: `mv ./jmlt4 /usr/bin/jmlt4`

&nbsp;
* [hahahahahahahahaha] one-liner bc yes: \
`git clone https://github.com/MaxWasTakenYT/jstmax-linux-toolbox && cd ./jstmax-linux-toolbox/build/ && chmod +x ./build-jmlt && ./build-jmlt`
