# jstmax!'s Linux Toolbox (or smth)
a set of stupid tools i created because idk i needed them on my laptop \
you could really just "gitignore" this repo since it's just a personal thing i needed to host somewhere

## available options;
* **-ju** / **--prepare-for-jstmax-use** : installs the packages that i would need on a fresh arch install.
* **-c** / **--custom-command** : enters a custom command, execute without the command, it will ask you the command later
* **-pmy** / **--pacman-yes** : full implementation of (now defunct) 'jm-pacmany'
* **-yy** / **--yay-yes** : full implementation of (now defunct) 'jm-yayy'

## build yourself;
* download/clone the repo
* open the 'build' folder
* check the 'README' file
