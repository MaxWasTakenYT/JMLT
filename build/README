[!] README - How to build JMLT
Preparation:
1. Install required packages if you didn't already: 'pacman -S figlet gcc'
2. Move inside the 'needed' folder: 'cd ./needed'
3. Give execute permissions to 'pacmany' and 'yayy' by running 'chmod +x ./pacmany && chmod +x ./yayy'
4. Add them to your PATH (e.g. 'cp ./pacmany /usr/bin/pacmany' and 'cp ./yayy /usr/bin/yayy')
Building:
1. Move inside the 'build' folder: 'cd ./build'
2. Give execute permissions to './build-jmlt' by running 'chmod +x ./build-jmlt'
3. Run './build-jmlt' in the 'build' folder
4. Done!

*Note: Make sure you have 'gcc' installed before building.
