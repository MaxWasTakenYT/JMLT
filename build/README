[!] README - How to build JMLT
1. Give permissions to './build-jmlt' by running 'chmod +x ./build-jmlt'
2. Run './build-jmlt' in the 'build' folder
3. Done!

*Note: Make sure you have 'gcc' installed before building.
*Note 2: To build again, you'll need to delete the 'JMLT.cpp' and 'jmlt4' files first.
